Convolutional Neural Network For Image Classification

Demonstrates the use of PyTorch for image classification by implementing a convolutional neural network to classify the CIFAR10 data set. This data set contains labelled images of various clothing items and a model was designed and trained to recognize these clothing items with high testing accuracy.
